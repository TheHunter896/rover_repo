Hello and Welcome to the instructions of the Rover game.

The game has only 1 JavaScript file and 1 HTML file to ask the user what to do, keep in mind
that this game is meant for the terminal (cmd) of the web browser you are using and that
only the actions you want to take will be asked by a prompt (there is no user interface).
